"""Local semantic injection detection — feature extraction, model, and scoring.

Everything runs in-process with zero network access: the classifier is a
compact logistic-regression model over hashed n-gram features, shipped as
``semantic_model.json`` next to this module and trained by
``tools/train_semantic_model.py`` over ``app/semantic_corpus.py``.

Feature family is chosen per script, because tokenisation cannot be uniform:
Latin/Cyrillic text is word-delimited (word 1/2-grams + within-word character
n-grams), while CJK/Kana/Hangul has no delimiters and is modelled with
character 1/2/3-grams over each run. Both feed one hashed bucket space.

Decision policy (mirrors the response-side DLP modes):

* ``off``     — the classifier is skipped entirely.
* ``monitor`` — scores at/above the threshold stay allowed but are flagged as
  suspected (visible in ``/api/v1/analyze`` output and audit logs).
* ``enforce`` — scores at/above the threshold block the request (403).

Independently of the mode, a score within ``SEMANTIC_SUSPECT_BAND`` *below* the
blocking threshold is flagged as suspected while still being allowed. That band
carries the audit trail through the region where this classifier is genuinely
uncertain, so the system can be conservative about blocking without going blind
— see ``SEMANTIC_SUSPECT_BAND``.

Configuration (read lazily per call, same pattern as the DLP engine):

* ``SHADOW_AGENT_SEMANTIC_MODE``      — off | monitor | enforce (default enforce)
* ``SHADOW_AGENT_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD`` — override the artifact threshold (0.5–0.99)

# the secrets to my bucket" — the strings are nearly identical to it. Forcing
# that zone into a binary is what made the layer fragile: a score shift of a few
# points from a retrain flipped a sample between "allowed silently" and
# "blocked", which is an expensive way to express uncertainty.
#
# A score inside the band is *allowed in every mode* but flagged as suspected:
# it lands in the audit trail and live console as a ``Monitored`` event and
# appears in ``/api/v1/analyze``. The band therefore keeps the region below the

# non-ASCII characters (mixed-script homoglyphs such as "disregаrd" with a
# Cyrillic "а"), or otherwise non-letter content. A plain lowercase ASCII word
# does not need them: the word and word-bigram features already carry its
# meaning.
#
# Emitting them for ordinary words as well is what made this layer's scores
# fragile. In a corpus of a few hundred samples a generic English trigram such
# as ``ere`` (from where/were/here/there) picks up positive weight by chance,
# so *any* English text — SQL, prose, code — rides it toward the threshold.
# Measured on the shipped v3 model: ``SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE
# created_at ...`` scored 0.70 with the character family contributing +1.96 of
# a +0.84 logit, and the worst benign calibration probe reached 0.95. That is
# why the old threshold had to sit at 0.85 (a floor set by avoiding false
# positives, not by in-corpus separation) and why dozens of injections crowded
# the band right next to it: the noise inflates everything, so the margin
# between benign and malicious collapses.
#
# Gating the family to non-word tokens drops the worst benign probe to 0.73 and
# *raises* recall: held-out encoding-obfuscation recall 6/7 -> 7/7, overall
# 87.2% -> 88% at the zero-false-positive operating point. Less feature noise
# means the word weights generalise better, so this is an improvement on both
# axes rather than a trade. Held-out probes confirm the direction: a novel
# mixed-script homoglyph moves 0.25 -> 0.54 and a leetspeak payload 0.42 ->
# 0.68 with this gating.
#
# Known residual: separators *inside* ASCII words ("instruc.tions") no longer
# get character n-grams, so a novel such split is still missed. That was true
# of v3 as well (it scored such a probe 0.17 — the corpus copy is only caught
# because it is memorised); closing it needs an explicit separator-collapse
# pass in the signature layer, which is tracked in the benchmark roadmap.
